"""ReportedIP blacklist — Source subclass (CSV, per-row multi-code classification).

`reportedip/reportedip-blacklist` (ReportedIP / Patrick Schlesinger, reportedip.de)
is a community-reputation feed backed by a first-party honeypot (WordPress /
Drupal / Joomla emulation, 36 threat analyzers) plus WordPress security plugins
and community reports. Only IPs with confidence >= 75% are listed; known-legit
CDN/search IPs are whitelisted; a 48-hour publication delay reduces false positives.

CSV columns: ``ip, confidence, categories, last_reported`` where ``categories``
is a ``;``-separated list of numeric codes. All 58 codes are officially
documented (per reportedip.com v2/categories API): 1-30 general attacks,
31-58 WordPress attack sub-categories. Each code maps via ``REPORTEDIP_MAP`` to
an IntelMQ ``classification.type``; ``REPORTEDIP_CODE_THEMATIC`` carries the
official per-code NAME for display. Codes are GROUPED by derived canonical type:
one ``Evidence`` per distinct type, each carrying ``native_categories`` = the
official names of its codes (deduped). Future codes absent from the tables
(59+) fall back to their raw numeric string. The canonical type is a derived
tag. IPv6 rows are harvested too (bare address, dual-family storage,
spec 2026-08-23).
