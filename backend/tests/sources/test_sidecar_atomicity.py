"""#4 sidecar atomicity: the .count/.cov sidecars must commit atomically with
the ptr swap so an OOM-kill / SIGKILL during rebuild can never leave a fresh
LMDB epoch paired with a stale or missing sidecar (which would silently
misreport record_count / covered_ips on the next load).

rebuild_lmdb stages .count + .cov to temp paths and os.replace()s them (then
the ptr) as the final step. A crash anywhere before that final step leaves
