"""SSE + snapshot endpoints.

`/api/tasks` is tested via TestClient (simple JSON response).

`/api/events` is tested by calling the endpoint function directly and
iterating its body generator. We can't use ``TestClient.stream()`` here because
httpx 0.28's ``ASGITransport.handle_async_request`` runs the entire ASGI app to
completion before returning the response — an infinite SSE generator therefore
deadlocks the transport. Calling the endpoint directly still exercises the real
StreamingResponse attributes (media_type, headers) and the real body generator
(initial snapshot event, unsubscribe on close).
